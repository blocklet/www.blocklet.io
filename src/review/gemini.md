# Why Blocklet Server? Top Selling Points

Blocklet Server is a next-generation application server designed for the decentralized web. It acts as a powerful, secure, and easy-to-use operating system for running modular applications called "Blocklets."

Whether you are a developer building a cutting-edge dApp or an administrator deploying robust services, Blocklet Server provides the tools and infrastructure to simplify development, streamline deployment, and embrace the future of the web.

Here are the key reasons to choose Blocklet Server.

## üöÄ For Developers: Build Faster & Smarter

Focus on your application's unique features, not on building and maintaining foundational services.

- **Rich Services Out-of-the-Box:** Stop reinventing the wheel. Leverage a suite of built-in services that your Blocklets can instantly use:
  - **Decentralized Identity (DID):** Built-in authentication and user management using DIDs.
  - **Powerful Routing:** Automatic HTTPS, custom domains, and traffic management.
  - **Event Bus:** Create composable, event-driven applications where Blocklets communicate seamlessly.
  - **Notifications:** Easily send notifications to your users about important events.
  - **And more:** Including Audit Logs, Access Control, and upcoming Payment services.

- **Modular & Composable Architecture:** Build your application as a collection of independent "Blocklets." This microservices-style approach makes your code cleaner, easier to maintain, and highly extensible.

- **Developer-Friendly Tooling:** We provide the tools you need to be productive:
  - **Robust SDK:** A simple yet powerful SDK (`@blocklet/sdk`) for easy integration with all platform services.
  - **Versatile CLI:** A feature-rich Command Line Interface (`@abtnode/cli`) for scripting, automation, and advanced management tasks.
  - **Effortless Deployment:** Deploy your Blocklet from your local machine with a single command.

## ‚öôÔ∏è For Operators & Administrators: Deploy & Manage with Ease

Blocklet Server is designed for stability, security, and simple administration.

- **One-Click Cloud Deployment:** Get up and running in minutes. Launch a fully configured Blocklet Server instance on AWS using our official, pre-built AMI.

- **Centralized Admin Dashboard:** A clean, intuitive web interface gives you complete control over your node.
  - **Full Blocklet Lifecycle Management:** Install, start, stop, configure, and upgrade your applications with a few clicks.
  - **System Overview:** Monitor node health, view logs, and track performance from a single place.
  - **User & Access Management:** Easily manage users, roles, and permissions across all your applications.

- **Secure by Design:** The platform is built with security as a top priority.
  - **Fine-Grained Access Control (ACL):** Define specific roles and permissions to ensure users can only access what they're supposed to.
  - **Automated Security:** The routing layer automatically applies security best practices like CORS and XSS protection headers.
  - **Complete Audit Trails:** Track every critical action performed on the server for security and compliance.

## üåê Core Philosophy: Built for the Decentralized Web

Blocklet Server is more than just a server; it's a commitment to a more open, secure, and user-centric internet.

- **Decentralization First:** We embrace decentralized technologies at our core. With native support for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and decentralized storage (DID Spaces), you can build applications that give users true ownership and control over their data.

- **Open & Extensible:** Blocklet Server is an open platform. We welcome contributions and provide the documentation and tools needed for developers to extend its capabilities and build the next wave of decentralized applications.
