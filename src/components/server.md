# Blocklet Server Features

Blocklet Server is a comprehensive platform for building, deploying, and managing modern applications. It provides a rich set of features that cater to developers, administrators, and end-users. Here's a detailed breakdown of what Blocklet Server offers:

## Core Platform

- **Blocklet-based Architecture:** Build your applications as modular, independent components called "Blocklets." This promotes code reusability, simplifies development, and makes your applications highly extensible.
- **Multi-language and Framework Support:** Blocklet Server is language-agnostic. You can build Blocklets using your favorite languages and frameworks, including Node.js, Python, Go, and more.
- **Run Anywhere:** Deploy Blocklet Server on any server, from your local machine to any cloud provider (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.). All you need is an SSH connection.
- **Extensible with Services:** Blocklet Server comes with a suite of built-in services that your Blocklets can leverage, including authentication, payments, and notifications.

## Deployment and DevOps

- **Git-based Deployment:** Integrate with your favorite Git providers (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) to enable seamless "push-to-deploy" workflows.
- **Free SSL Certificates:** Automatically provision and renew Let's Encrypt SSL certificates for your custom domains.
- **No Vendor Lock-in:** You have complete control over your data and infrastructure. All settings and data are stored on your own servers.
- **Automated Database Backups:** Schedule automatic backups of your databases to any S3-compatible storage solution.
- **Webhooks:** Integrate with your CI/CD pipelines and other tools using webhooks.
- **Powerful API:** Automate deployments, manage resources, and build custom integrations with the Blocklet Server API.
- **Pull Request Deployments:** Automatically deploy new commits and pull requests to separate environments for easy review and collaboration.

## Management and Operations

- **Centralized Dashboard:** A user-friendly web interface for managing all aspects of your Blocklet Server.

- **Collaborative Environment:** Invite team members to collaborate on projects with role-based access control.
- **Server Automation:** Blocklet Server automates many server management tasks, allowing you to focus on your code.
