# Custom Rules: Define specific page generation rules and requirements
rules: >-
  1. Generate a home page for the entire Blocklet platform, as well as a subpage for each component of the platform.

  2. The home page should include a section for each component — such as Blocklet Server, Blocklet Service, Blocklet SDK, Blocklet CLI, Blocklet Store, and Blocklet Launcher — and each section should link to its corresponding subpage.

  3. Each component subpage should focus on the component itself, serve as a dedicated landing page, and include a link back to the home page.

  4. Except for the home page, the hero section structure of each subpage should be different from that of the home page, to highlight each component’s unique visual style and key message.

  5. Each page should include a footer section containing links to all other pages, allowing users to easily navigate across the entire site.

  6. On the blocklet-cli page, if there are any .cast files available, use them instead of PNG images to display code.
