    faqTitle: "Frequently Asked Questions"
    faqList:
      - question: "What exactly is a Blocklet Service?"
        answer: "Think of it as a standardized, reusable feature-set (like authentication or notifications) that a Blocklet offers. Other apps can then 'plug into' this service without needing to build it themselves."
      - question: "How do different Blocklets find and use these services?"
        answer: "Services are discoverable through predictable URL endpoints, typically starting with `/.well-known/service`. This allows for automated and reliable inter-blocklet communication."
      - question: "Can I create my own shareable Blocklet Service?"
        answer: "Yes, absolutely! The framework is designed for you to package your own unique functionalities as a service, contributing to a richer, more powerful ecosystem for everyone."
      - question: "How is this different from a standard API?"
        answer: "While a service uses an API, the 'service' pattern standardizes how it's discovered, described, and consumed. This ensures true composability, where components from different developers can reliably work together."
