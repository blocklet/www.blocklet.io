  - sectionName: "serverFaq"
    sectionSummary: "An FAQ section to proactively address common questions and concerns, helping to overcome potential objections and provide clarity on key differentiators."
    faqTitle: "Frequently Asked Questions"
    faqList:
      - question: "What exactly is Blocklet Server?"
        answer: "Blocklet Server acts as a runtime environment or an 'operating system' for decentralized applications (Blocklets). It handles all the complex infrastructure like routing, security, user management, and updates, so you can focus on building your app."
      - question: "How is this different from Docker or Coolify?"
        answer: "While tools like Docker manage containers, Blocklet Server is a higher-level application platform. It provides a full ecosystem with a built-in app store, decentralized identity (DID), and standardized services that your apps can use out-of-the-box, which goes far beyond simple container orchestration."
      - question: "What databases does Blocklet Server support?"
        answer: "It's built for flexibility! For simplicity and ease of setup, it comes with SQLite by default. For larger, production-grade deployments, you can easily switch to PostgreSQL for superior performance and scalability."
      - question: "Can I run this on my own hardware, like a Raspberry Pi?"
        answer: "Absolutely! Blocklet Server is designed to run anywhere. It supports both AMD64 (standard servers) and ARM64 architectures, making it perfect for everything from enterprise data centers to edge devices like a Raspberry Pi."
      - question: "What languages and frameworks can I use to build Blocklets?"
        answer: "Pretty much anything! The runtime is language-agnostic. While we have deep integration and amazing SDKs for Node.js, you can run apps built in Python, Go, PHP, or even static sites. If it can run on a server, you can package it as a blocklet."
