      - question: "How does the subscription and billing work?"

        answer: "Absolutely. We prioritize your data's safety. For dedicated instances, we offer optional disk backups. Plus, our integration with DID Spaces allows you to restore your apps and data seamlessly."
      - question: "What happens if I decide to cancel my subscription?"
        answer: "If you cancel, your app will remain active until the end of your current billing period. We have clear expiration safeguards in place, so you'll know exactly when your instance will be deprovisioned."
      - question: "Can I bring my own team to manage the apps?"
