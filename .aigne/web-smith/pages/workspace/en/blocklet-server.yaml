    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions"
    "faqList":
      - "question": "What exactly is Blocklet Server?"
        "answer": "Think of it as the operating system for your modern, decentralized
          applications! It's a secure and powerful runtime environment that
          manages the entire lifecycle of your Blocklets, from installation to
          scaling."
      - "question": "What is a Blocklet?"
        "answer": "A Blocklet is a modular, reusable application component. You can
          build entire applications by composing multiple Blocklets together,
          which makes development faster, cleaner, and more scalable."
      - "question": "What languages and frameworks can I use?"
        "answer": "Pretty much anything you love! Blocklet Server is language-agnostic,
          with first-class support for Node.js, but you can run apps built with
          Python, Go, PHP, or even static sites."
      - "question": "Where can I deploy Blocklet Server?"
        "answer": "Anywhere you want! You can run it on your local machine for
          development, or deploy it to any cloud provider like AWS and
          DigitalOcean. You have complete control over your infrastructure."
      - "question": "Can I run my existing Docker applications on Blocklet Server?"
        "answer": "Absolutely! Blocklet Server has built-in Docker support, allowing you
          to deploy and manage your containerized applications seamlessly. You
          get the best of both worlds—the power of Blocklets and the flexibility
          of your existing Docker workflow."
      - "question": "How does it handle security?"
        "answer": "Security is at our core! We provide DID-based authentication,
          fine-grained access control, a Web Application Firewall, automated
          SSL, and much more right out of the box."
      - "question": "Is this only for Web3 or blockchain apps?"
        "answer": "Not at all! While it has powerful, built-in Web3 capabilities like
          Decentralized Identity (DID), it's also a fantastic platform for
          building and deploying traditional web applications. You get the best
          of both worlds!"
