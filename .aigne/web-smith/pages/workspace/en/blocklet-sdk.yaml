    faqTitle: "Frequently Asked Questions"
    faqList:
      - question: "Is the Blocklet SDK only for Node.js?"
        answer: "Not at all! We provide two main SDKs: `@blocklet/node-sdk` for your backend services and `@blocklet/js-sdk` for your client-side browser applications. You get the tools you need for the entire stack."
      - question: "How does authentication work with the SDK?"
        answer: "The SDK makes it incredibly simple! It fully integrates with DID Connect, allowing you to implement secure, passwordless authentication where users sign in with their decentralized identity wallet."
      - question: "Can my blocklet communicate with other blocklets?"
        answer: "Absolutely! That's a core part of the platform's composable design. The SDK provides access to federated services and an event bus, enabling seamless and secure inter-blocklet communication."
      - question: "Do I need to manage my own database connection?"
        answer: "Nope! The SDK includes a simple, built-in database module (NeDB) that's perfect for most use cases, getting you up and running without any complex setup. You can focus on building features, not on database admin."
      - question: "Where can I find the full API documentation?"
        answer: "You can dive into our comprehensive technical documentation to explore all the modules, classes, and methods available. Check out the Architecture page for a deep dive!"
