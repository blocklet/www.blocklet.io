    faqTitle: "Frequently Asked Architecture Questions"
    faqList:
      - question: "How does the platform handle data storage?"
        answer: "It's super flexible! By default, it uses an embedded SQLite database which is perfect for single-server setups. For larger, clustered deployments, you can easily switch to PostgreSQL for superior performance and scalability."
      - question: "What is 'Graceful Reload' and why does it matter?"
        answer: "It's our zero-downtime update system! It allows you to update the server or individual blocklets without dropping any active connections. This means you can deploy updates anytime without interrupting your users—a total game-changer for availability."
      - question: "How does inter-blocklet communication work?"
        answer: "Blocklets communicate through a central API Gateway and an asynchronous event messaging system. This allows them to discover each other automatically and interact securely without being tightly coupled, following best practices for microservice design."
      - question: "What kind of monitoring and observability tools are included?"
        answer: "The platform is built for production! It includes structured JSON logging, real-time performance and resource metrics (CPU, memory, etc.), and configurable alerting. You'll have all the insights you need to keep your system healthy."
